# Toki Pona Course by ChatGPT

## Prompt

I want you to help me learn Toki Pona during my Christmas break which lasts 25 days.

I need you to consider the best approach to learning this language in that time frame and create lessons that will guide me through the process.

While I will attempt to do a lesson a day, I may need to miss some due to other engagements. Build flexibility into the schedule to allow for this.

Structure each lesson in such as way as to revise and leverage previous lessons and always include space for recaps and questions.

Start by giving me your course outline and prompt me for suggestions or questions.
